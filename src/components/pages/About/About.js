      <h2>Hello there, I'm Nifer Kilakila,</h2>
      <h3>aspiring web developer, a lifetime Maker, and fiber artist, one who thrives tackling adaptive and technical challenges. </h3>
      <h4>
        <p>Although coding is relatively new for me, I have already been working for the last 15+ years utilizing the principles and soft skills needed to thrive in programming.</p>
        <p>I ran my own businesses for over 8 years, as well as worked tirelessly in fundraising for small nonprofits for several years. Building my businesses from the ground up required self-organization, research, and the ability to develop internal systems and processes, and I enjoyed every minute of it. Nonprofit work also brought its own set of challenges and rewards â€” like learning to analyze and manipulate SOQL queries, or learning formulas in GoogleSheets, so that I could better serve my donor base.</p>
        <p>I was drawn to web development because of the blend of both technical and creative challenges that it provides. As a highly creative person, I can also be process-driven, think scale, and rely on data to make decisions, and the challenges that coding provides seemed like a perfect fit.</p>
        <p>Through my time at Berkeley Extension Bootcamp, I have really enjoyed working in collaboration with other driven people. What a great feeling it is to find a perplexing bug, spend hours sifting through and modifying code, collaborate with a colleague about the problem, and discover the solution together!  I'm looking forward to many more of these collaborative puzzle solving as I continue my journey into coding.</p>
