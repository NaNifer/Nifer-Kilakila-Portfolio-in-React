## Overview

Hi there! This is my personal portfolio page built in React, which features some of my github projects as well as my resume and technical skills.  I had a lot of fun making this something I can continue building and using. I'm continually adding projects, modifying content, and updating the look and functionality. 

I hope that it is a good representation of who I am as a person and engineer. If you would like to use this template for your own portfolio, please give me some props. Thanks!

A huge shout out to [nullaus](https://github.com/nullaus) who was my quick dial on all the random questions about JS, and taught me that the arguments of functions could call on variables inside of other functions.
